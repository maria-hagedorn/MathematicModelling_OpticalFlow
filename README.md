## For GitHub use
### First time (connecting)
1. git clone [copy https url from green code button]

### All other times
1. git pull

### To add new work (push to repo)
1. git add . (note: . is for "all", throw stuff you don't want to add in .gitignore)
2. git commit -m "commit message"
3. git pull (note: we need to pull to avoid conflicts, if I create a new file and you don't pull before push, that file would theoretically be deleted, in reality you wouldn't be able to push)
4. git push
